    <p>
        In Last Man Standing (LMS), you must pick one team each round.
        If your team wins, you progress to the next round.
        If your team loses (or draws), you are eliminated.
        Each team can only be used once per game.
    </p>

    <h3>⏰ Pick Deadlines</h3>

    <p>
        Each LMS game uses one of the following deadline rules:
    </p>

    <h4>1️⃣ Extended Deadline</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You can make your pick up until the kickoff time of the match you select.</li>
        <li>Different players can pick at different times within the round.</li>
        <li>If you do not make a pick, nothing happens automatically until the round is processed.</li>
        <li>Player picks are not visible until no further picks are necessary, or the deadline has passed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2️⃣ First Game Deadline</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The round closes when the <strong>first match of the round kicks off</strong>.</li>
        <li>After this point, no manual picks are allowed.</li>
        <li>Any player who has not picked will be handled automatically based on the game’s rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>🤖 What Happens If You Don’t Pick?</h3>

    <p>
        If the round closes and you haven’t made a pick, the game will apply the
        configured <strong>No Pick Rule</strong>:
    </p>

    <h4>Random Away Team</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>When the round is created, the system pre-selects one valid away teams.</li>
        <li>
            This team is guaranteed to be:
            <ul>
                <li>Playing in the round</li>
                <li>Not already used by any remaining player</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you fail to pick before the deadline, this teams will be automatically assigned to you.</li>
        <li>This auto-pick is visible in advance, so you always know what will happen.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Auto-picks are only used from Round 2 onwards.
        Round 1 always requires a manual pick and entry into the game.
    </p>

    <h3>📅 Postponed & Cancelled Matches</h3>

    <p>
        Sometimes fixtures do not go ahead as planned. LMS handles these situations
        fairly and consistently.
    </p>

    <h4>Unfinished Matches</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If a match is postponed and still unresolved by the end of the round:</li>
        <li>The system will automatically assign a valid replacement team and fixture.</li>
        <li>This only happens once the round’s scheduled end date has passed.</li>
        <li>The replacement team follows the same rules as auto-picks (unused and valid).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>🏆 Winning the Game</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The game continues round by round until only one player remains.</li>
        <li>If exactly one player is left alive, they win the prize pot.</li>
        <li>If all remaining players are eliminated in the same round, the game ends with no winner.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Good luck — and remember: sometimes not picking is still a strategy 😉
