 <h1>⚽ Football Prediction Scoring Rules</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to the football prediction game! Points are awarded for both the <strong>accuracy of your scoreline predictions</strong> and your ability to judge the overall match result. 
    Read below to see how you can rack up points and edge out the competition!
  </p>

  <h2>Main Scoring System</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">10 points</span> – Predict the <strong>exact score</strong> (e.g., 2–1 when the final score is 2–1).</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">5 points</span> – Predict the <strong>correct result</strong> only (home win, draw, or away win), but not the exact score.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tie-Breaker: Alternate Scoring System</h2>
  <p>
    If two or more players finish with the same score, we use the <strong>alternate scoring system</strong> to decide the winner. This system rewards accuracy in smaller details of your prediction.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Result Prediction (3 points)</h3>
  <p>
    Earn <span class="highlight">3 points</span> if you correctly predict whether the game ends in a home win, draw, or away win. 
    <br />Predict incorrectly? You score <span class="highlight">0</span>.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Home Team Goals (up to 3 points)</h3>
  <p>
    Predict the number of goals scored by the home team. You start with <span class="highlight">3 points</span> for a perfect prediction, 
    but lose 1 point for every goal you’re off.  
  </p>
  <div class="example">
    Examples:  
    <br />Predict 3 goals and they score 3 → <strong>3 points</strong>  
    <br />Predict 2 goals and they score 1 → <strong>2 points</strong>  
    <br />Predict 4 goals and they score 0 → <strong>0 points</strong>  
  </div>

  <h3>3. Away Team Goals (up to 3 points)</h3>
  <p>
    Exactly the same system applies to the away team’s goals.
  </p>

  <div class="bonus">
    <strong>Maximum Points Available:</strong>  
    <br />3 (Result) + 3 (Home Goals) + 3 (Away Goals) = <strong>9 points</strong>.  
    <br />But… if you get the exact correct scoreline, you earn a <strong>bonus point</strong>, making it a total of <span class="highlight">10 points</span>!
  </div>

  <h2>Final Word</h2>
  <p>
    This system rewards both bold and precise predictions. Go for the exact score to hit the jackpot, but remember—even being close counts!
